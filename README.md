# pugFrontendFramework

This is a pretty opinionated frontend framework.
It's going to render pug templates suing js functions and apply
diffs on DOM like react and others do.

It's allso supposed to be based on pattern design approach
and thanks to rollup we only get that css/pug into the build
which really is used.
